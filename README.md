This is a project that explores the relationship between people's daily activities, habits and the potential disease 
that they might have in the future.

I downloaded a dataset from the Internet and applied several machine learning algorithms on it in order to see if the 
program was able to make predictions, which are potential symptoms that a user might be suffering from in the future, 
based upon the given input. I estimated the performance by reshuffling the dataset and trained the algorithm again 
before testing it on the test set. The final result obtained was 56%. Although the result is not ideal, the improvements
of the program can be seen along the way when I am making adjustments in different versions of my algorithm. The 
implication of this project is that if more medical research effort can be put into this area, which implies that 
more reliable and professional data can be collected, machines would be able to give a reasonably good prediction to 
users as a gentle warning before an actual symptom occurs.

For more details, please read my report.

Dataset is retrieved from [flaredown](http://flaredown.com).

Python library used is Scikit-learn.


**General instruction:**


datarearrangement.py is the code to process the raw data

NN.py or deep_NN.py is applying the algorithm to the processed data

traing.txt is the training set

dev.txt is the dev set

other text files are intermediate results
